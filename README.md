## Options
**-V, --version**
> Output the version number

**-r, --recursive**
> Walk given directory recursively

**-f, --files <items>**
> Files to convert, split by ','

**--lossless**
> Encode the image without any loss. For images with fully transparent area, the
> invisible pixel values (R/G/B or Y/U/V) will be preserved only if the -exact
> option is used

**--near_lossless <int>**
> Specify the level of near-lossless image preprocessing. This option adjusts
> pixel values to help compressibility, but has minimal impact on the visual
> quality. It triggers lossless compression mode automatically. The range is 0
> (maximum preprocessing) to 100 (no preprocessing, the default). The typical
> value is around 60. Note that lossy with -q 100 can at times yield better
> results.

**-q, --quality <float>**
> Specify the compression factor for RGB channels between 0 and 100. The default
> is 75. In case of lossy compression (default), a small factor produces a
> smaller file with lower quality. Best quality is achieved by using a value of
> 100. In case of lossless compression (specified by the -lossless option), a
> small factor enables faster compression speed, but produces a larger file.
> Maximum compression is achieved by using a value of 100. (default: 75)

**-z, --zip <float>**
> Switch on lossless compression mode with the specified level between 0 and 9,
> with level 0 being the fastest, 9 being the slowest. Fast mode produces larger
> file size than slower ones. A good default is -z 6. This option is actually a
> shortcut for some predefined settings for quality and method. If options -q or
> -m are subsequently used, they will invalidate the effect of this option.

**--alpha_q <int>**
> Specify the compression factor for alpha compression between 0 and 100.
> Lossless compression of alpha is achieved using a value of 100, while the lower
> values result in a lossy compression. The default is 100.

**--preset <string>**
> Specify a set of pre-defined parameters to suit a particular type of source
> material. Possible values are: default, photo, picture, drawing, icon, text.
> Since -preset overwrites the other parameters values (except the -q one), this
> option should preferably appear first in the order of the arguments.

**-m, --method <int>**
> Specify the compression method to use. This parameter controls the trade off
> between encoding speed and the compressed file size and quality. Possible
> values range from 0 to 6. Default value is 4. When higher values are used, the
> encoder will spend more time inspecting additional encoding possibilities and
> decide on the quality gain. Lower value can result in faster processing time at
> the expense of larger file size and lower compression quality.

**--resize <width/height>**
> Resize the source to a rectangle with size width x height. If either (but not
> both) of the width or height parameters is 0, the value will be calculated
> preserving the aspect-ratio.

**--crop <x_position/y_position/width/height>**
> Crop the source to a rectangle with top-left corner at coordinates (x_position,
> y_position) and size width x height. This cropping area must be fully contained
> within the source rectangle.

**-mt, --multithread**
> Use multi-threading for encoding, if possible.

**--low_memory**
> Reduce memory usage of lossy encoding by saving four times the compressed size
> (typically). This will make the encoding slower and the output slightly
> different in size and distortion. This flag is only effective for methods 3 and
> up, and is off by default. Note that leaving this flag off will have some side
> effects on the bitstream: it forces certain bitstream features like number of
> partitions (forced to 1). Note that a more detailed report of bitstream size is
> printed by cwebp when using this option.

**--size <int>**
> Specify a target size (in bytes) to try and reach for the compressed output.
> The compressor will make several passes of partial encoding in order to get as
> close as possible to this target. If both -size and -psnr are used, -size value
> will prevail.

**--psnr <float>**
> Specify a target PSNR (in dB) to try and reach for the compressed output. The
> compressor will make several passes of partial encoding in order to get as
> close as possible to this target. If both -size and -psnr are used, -size value
> will prevail.

**--pass <int>**
> Set a maximum number of passes to use during the dichotomy used by options
> -size or -psnr. Maximum value is 10, default is 1. If options -size or -psnr
> were used, but -pass wasn't specified, a default value of '6' passes will be
> used.

**-af, --autofilter**
> Turns auto-filter on. This algorithm will spend additional time optimizing the
> filtering strength to reach a well-balanced quality.

**--jpeg_like**
> Change the internal parameter mapping to better match the expected size of JPEG
> compression. This flag will generally produce an output file of similar size to
> its JPEG equivalent (for the same -q setting), but with less visual distortion.

**--filter <int>**
> Specify the strength of the deblocking filter, between 0 (no filtering) and 100
> (maximum filtering). A value of 0 will turn off any filtering. Higher value
> will increase the strength of the filtering process applied after decoding the
> picture. The higher the value the smoother the picture will appear. Typical
> values are usually in the range of 20 to 50.

**--sharpness <int>**
> Specify the sharpness of the filtering (if used). Range is 0 (sharpest) to 7
> (least sharp). Default is 0.

**--strong**
> Use strong filtering (if filtering is being used thanks to the -f option).
> Strong filtering is on by default.

**--nostrong**
> Disable strong filtering (if filtering is being used thanks to the -f option)
> and use simple filtering instead.

**--sharp_yuv**
> Use more accurate and sharper RGB->YUV conversion if needed. Note that this
> process is slower than the default 'fast' RGB->YUV conversion.

**--sns <int>**
> Specify the amplitude of the spatial noise shaping. Spatial noise shaping (or
> sns for short) refers to a general collection of built-in algorithms used to
> decide which area of the picture should use relatively less bits, and where
> else to better transfer these bits. The possible range goes from 0 (algorithm
> is off) to 100 (the maximal effect). The default value is 50.

**--segments <int>**
> Change the number of partitions to use during the segmentation of the sns
> algorithm. Segments should be in range 1 to 4. Default value is 4. This option
> has no effect for methods 3 and up, unless -low_memory is used.

**--partition_limit <int>**
> Degrade quality by limiting the number of bits used by some macroblocks. Range
> is 0 (no degradation, the default) to 100 (full degradation). Useful values are
> usually around 30-70 for moderately large images. In the VP8 format, the
> so-called control partition has a limit of 512k and is used to store the
> following information: whether the macroblock is skipped, which segment it
> belongs to, whether it is coded as intra 4x4 or intra 16x16 mode, and finally
> the prediction modes to use for each of the sub-blocks. For a very large image,
> 512k only leaves room to few bits per 16x16 macroblock. The absolute minimum is
> 4 bits per macroblock. Skip, segment, and mode information can use up almost
> all these 4 bits (although the case is unlikely), which is problematic for very
> large images. The partition_limit factor controls how frequently the most
> bit-costly mode (intra 4x4) will be used. This is useful in case the 512k limit
> is reached and the following message is displayed: Error code: 6
> (PARTITION0_OVERFLOW: Partition #0 is too big to fit 512k). If using
> -partition_limit is not enough to meet the 512k constraint, one should use less
> segments in order to save more header bits per macroblock. See the -segments
> option.

**-v, --verbose**
> Print extra information (encoding time in particular).

**--print_psnr**
> Compute and report average PSNR (Peak-Signal-To-Noise ratio).

**--print_ssim**
> Compute and report average SSIM (structural similarity metric, see
> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSIM for additional details).

**--print_lsim**
> Compute and report local similarity metric (sum of lowest error amongst the
> collocated pixel neighbors).

**--progress**
> Report encoding progress in percent.

**--quiet**
> Do not print anything.

**--short**
> Only print brief information (output file size and PSNR) for testing purposes.

**--map <int>**
> Output additional ASCII-map of encoding information. Possible map values range
> from 1 to 6. This is only meant to help debugging.

**-s, --specify <width/height>**
> Specify that the input file actually consists of raw Y'CbCr samples following
> the ITU-R BT.601 recommendation, in 4:2:0 linear format. The luma plane has
> size width x height.

**--pre <int>**
> Specify some pre-processing steps. Using a value of 2 will trigger
> quality-dependent pseudo-random dithering during RGBA->YUVA conversion (lossy
> compression only).

**--alpha_filter <string>**
> Specify the predictive filtering method for the alpha plane. One of none, fast
> or best, in increasing complexity and slowness order. Default is fast.
> Internally, alpha filtering is performed using four possible predictions (none,
> horizontal, vertical, gradient). The best mode will try each mode in turn and
> pick the one which gives the smaller size. The fast mode will just try to form
> an a priori guess without testing all modes.

**--alpha_method <int>**
> Specify the algorithm used for alpha compression: 0 or 1. Algorithm 0 denotes
> no compression, 1 uses WebP lossless format for compression. The default is 1.

**--exact**
> Preserve RGB values in transparent area. The default is off, to help
> compressibility.

**--blend_alpha <int>**
> This option blends the alpha channel (if present) with the source using the
> background color specified in hexadecimal as 0xrrggbb. The alpha channel is
> afterward reset to the opaque value 255.

**--noalpha**
> Using this option will discard the alpha channel.

**--hint <string>**
> Specify the hint about input image type. Possible values are: photo, picture or
> graph.

**--metadata <string>**
> A comma separated list of metadata to copy from the input to the output if
> present. Valid values: all, none, exif, icc, xmp. The default is none. Note
> that each input format may not support all combinations.

**--noasm**
> Disable all assembly optimizations.

**-h, --help**
> Display help for command
